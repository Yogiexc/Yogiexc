## 👋 About Me

```yaml
name: Bryan Yogie Saputra
location: Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia 🇮🇩
education: Informatics Engineering Student @ Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS)
status: Learning & Building
motto: "In progress, not in a rush"
```

Hi! I'm Bryan, a student who's passionate about learning web development and programming. I'm still in the early stages of my journey, but I love exploring different technologies and trying to understand how things work.

**🌱 What I'm Currently Learning:**
- Backend development with Go (still a beginner!)
- Building REST APIs and understanding how they work
- Frontend frameworks (trying React, Vue, and Svelte to see what clicks)
- Basic database concepts (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code

**📚 My Learning Approach:**
- Using GitHub as my learning journal - lots of experiments and "figuring things out" here
- Learning by building small projects (even if they're not perfect)
- Trying different technologies to find what I enjoy most
- Not afraid to make mistakes - that's how I learn best
- Slowly building up my fundamentals

- Build 2-3 projects that actually work well
- Get comfortable with one backend language (probably Go)
- Understand the basics of system design
- Maybe contribute to open source (when I'm ready!)
- Write code that doesn't make me cringe when I look back at it

**Long-term (Learning Journey):**
- Become comfortable with backend development
- Build something people actually use
- Understand how large-scale applications work
- Keep learning and stay curious
